# Car-Counter
The Car Counter Project is a computer vision-based application that automatically detects and counts vehicles as they pass through a predefined region in a video feed. This project is useful for traffic analysis, smart city infrastructure, and vehicle flow monitoring.
This project is ideal for traffic monitoring systems, smart city analytics, and transportation research. It combines the power of OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLO, and custom tracking logic to deliver efficient and accurate vehicle counting.
